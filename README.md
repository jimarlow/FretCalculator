# FretCalculator

Two fret position calculators:

1. Equal temperament fret calculator - used for guitars or any equally tempered fretted instrument.

2. John Dowland fret calculator - a sweeter temperament for lutes and baroque guitars from "A Varietie of Lute Lessons".

I am particularly fond of the Dowland temperament!

These calculators are provided in a Jupyter Notebook along with their full source code and theory of operation here:
